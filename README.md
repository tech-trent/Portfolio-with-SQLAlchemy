# Treehouse-Python-Techdegree-Project-5
A web app designed to keep and alter detailed records about what the user has learned, which makes extensive use of "Flask" and the "Peewee ORM".

Users are able to:
  - Create records
  - Edit records in their entirety (all 5 fields)
  - Delete records

Records are selected by their Peewee-given ID number, which also functions as their primary key within the database.

In-depth descriptions of all functions and classes in `app.py` and the two modules are included in docstrings.

Code is PEP-8 compliant according to http://pep8online.com/
